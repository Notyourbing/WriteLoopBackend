      "question": "The most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?",
      "word_count_reported": 300,
      "body_paragraphs": [
        "Science is often judged by the comfort and security it brings to ordinary people. I agree that improving human lives should be a major aim of scientific work, because public resources and public trust are involved. However, I do not think this aim should be interpreted so narrowly that we discourage basic research whose benefits are unpredictable.",
        "In the most obvious sense, science improves lives when it targets urgent human needs. Medical research has reduced suffering through vaccines, antibiotics and safer surgery, while public health science has delivered clean water and better sanitation. Similarly, research into renewable energy, climate forecasting and drought-resistant crops can prevent crises rather than merely respond to them. When scientific priorities are linked to wellbeing in this way, societies gain measurable returns in the form of longer lives, higher productivity and greater resilience.",
        "That said, the line from discovery to improved living standards is not always direct. Many breakthroughs that now underpin modern life emerged from curiosity-driven inquiry. Early research into electricity and magnetism, for example, was not intended to create smartphones or high-speed trains, yet it eventually made both possible. If every project had to show an immediate impact on quality of life, researchers would avoid long-term questions and we would lose the foundational knowledge that later generates life-changing applications.",
        "In my view, the best position is to treat human wellbeing as the ultimate destination but allow multiple routes to reach it. Governments and universities should fund a balanced portfolio: mission-oriented work for pressing problems, alongside fundamental research that expands understanding. This combination both solves today's challenges and seeds tomorrow's innovations.",
        "Overall, improving people's lives should be the central justification for science in society, but it should not become a restrictive rule that prevents exploration and long-term progress."

      "title": "University Students: Breadth vs Specialisation",
      "question": "Some university students want to learn about other subjects in addition to their main subjects. Others believe it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.",
      "word_count_reported": 280,
      "body_paragraphs": [
        "University students often face a choice between specialising deeply in one discipline and studying a wider range of subjects. Both approaches can be beneficial, but I believe students should prioritise their main qualification while taking a limited number of carefully selected electives.",
        "Those who support studying additional subjects argue that most real-world problems are interdisciplinary. A software developer, for instance, may need psychology to design user-friendly products, and a business graduate may require statistics to evaluate evidence. Learning outside a major can therefore produce graduates who communicate across fields, think creatively and adapt to changing job markets. Moreover, exposure to arts, history or philosophy can develop judgement and ethical awareness, which are valuable in professions that increasingly affect society through technology and policy.",
        "On the other hand, advocates of full concentration point out that a degree is primarily a signal of competence. Many programmes are already demanding, with intensive reading, laboratory work or professional placements. If students spread their time across unrelated subjects, they may fail to master the core content needed for employment or licensing. This is particularly relevant in medicine, engineering and accounting, where gaps in foundational knowledge can have serious consequences.",
        "In my opinion, universities should encourage breadth, but not at the expense of depth. The most sensible model is to keep the major as the central focus while allowing students to choose a small number of electives that either strengthen transferable skills or complement their main field. With sensible limits and good academic advising, students can become both capable specialists and well-rounded thinkers.",

For governments, concentrating people in one place can reduce the cost of infrastructure, because providing transport, electricity and specialist healthcare to remote villages is expensive. From this perspective, migration may look like an efficient path to development.",
        "However, rural decline carries serious social and economic costs. When young adults move away, villages lose workers, entrepreneurs and future parents, which accelerates ageing and reduces local demand for shops and services. Schools close due to a lack of children, public transport becomes unviable, and loneliness increases among the elderly who remain. At the same time, cities may struggle to absorb newcomers. Housing shortages, high rents, traffic congestion and air pollution worsen, and public services such as water supply, waste management and clinics can become overstretched. In extreme cases, informal settlements expand, creating new inequalities and health risks.",
        "A healthier outcome would be balanced development that reduces the pressure to migrate. Governments can invest in rural broadband, modern farming technology and small-town industries so that people can build careers outside major cities. Better transport links and remote work options can also make rural life compatible with professional ambition.",

Many provide childcare for grandchildren, volunteer in local organisations and offer wisdom in community decision-making. In workplaces that allow flexible retirement, experienced staff can mentor younger employees and reduce skills shortages.",
        "Nevertheless, an ageing population creates heavy financial and structural pressures. Pension systems depend on a stable ratio of workers to retirees, and as that ratio falls, governments face painful choices: higher taxes, reduced benefits or increased public debt. Healthcare and social care spending also rises because chronic conditions are more common in later life and may require long-term support. Beyond budgets, labour shortages can slow economic growth, making it harder to fund public services. In some places, ageing electorates may also resist reforms, delaying necessary adjustments to housing, transport and education.",
        "These problems can be managed, but doing so is difficult. Governments may need to raise retirement ages gradually, invest in preventive healthcare, support lifelong learning and make it easier for women and older adults to remain in the workforce. Selective immigration and automation can help, but both require careful planning to maintain social cohesion.",

Discovering such issues early can prevent expensive repairs and protect property value. Another motivation is identity and curiosity. People often feel more connected to a place when they understand who lived there before, how the neighbourhood developed and whether the building has historical significance. In older cities, a home might even be linked to notable events or architectural styles, which adds a sense of pride.",
        "To research a property's history, the most direct method is to consult official records. Land registries, local councils and planning departments often hold documents about ownership, building permits and renovations. Historical maps and census data can also reveal how an area changed over time. In addition, libraries and local archives may contain newspapers, photographs and heritage listings that mention the building or street. Another useful approach is to speak with long-term residents. Neighbours, previous owners and community organisations can provide details that are not written down, such as stories about past uses of the building or major incidents in the area.",

Homeowners want to know whether a property has structural problems, past flooding, illegal renovations or unresolved disputes. Discovering such issues early can prevent expensive repairs and protect property value. Another motivation is identity and curiosity. People often feel more connected to a place when they understand who lived there before, how the neighbourhood developed and whether the building has historical significance. In older cities, a home might even be linked to notable events or architectural styles, which adds a sense of pride.\n\nTo research a property's history, the most direct method is to consult official records. Land registries, local councils and planning departments often hold documents about ownership, building permits and renovations. Historical maps and census data can also reveal how an area changed over time. In addition, libraries and local archives may contain newspapers, photographs and heritage listings that mention the building or street. Another useful approach is to speak with long-term residents. Neighbours, previous owners and community organisations can provide details that are not written down, such as stories about past uses of the building or major incidents in the area.\n\nFinally, modern tools make research easier. Online databases, genealogy websites and even social media groups focused on local history can connect people with experts and sources.\n\nIn summary, people investigate their homes because they want to manage risks and develop a stronger connection to where they live. By combining official records with community knowledge, it is often possible to build a clear picture of a building's past.",

      "word_count_reported": 301,
      "body_paragraphs": [
        "It is common for companies to promote products as \"new\" or \"improved\" in their advertising. This happens mainly because businesses compete for attention in crowded markets, and novelty is a powerful way to persuade consumers. Overall, I think this trend is mixed but slightly negative because it encourages unnecessary consumption.",
        "The first reason for highlighting novelty is differentiation. When many brands sell similar items, a company needs a clear message that makes its product stand out. By claiming a new feature, a fresh design or a faster performance, advertisers create a sense that the product is superior or more modern than alternatives. This strategy also taps into consumer psychology: people often associate \"new\" with better quality and fear missing out if they do not upgrade.",
        "Another reason is that rapid innovation, especially in electronics, creates genuine improvements that companies want to communicate. Smartphone cameras, battery life and security systems can improve each year, and consumers may benefit from knowing what has changed.",
        "Despite these points, the emphasis on constant novelty can have negative consequences. It can normalise frequent replacement even when older products still work well, leading to waste and environmental damage. It also pushes consumers towards impulsive buying and debt, particularly when marketing suggests that social status depends on owning the latest model. In addition, some \"innovations\" are cosmetic, designed mainly to restart the buying cycle rather than solve real problems.",
        "A more positive direction would be to advertise durability, repairability and long-term value. Governments can also support this by requiring clearer information about product lifespan and by promoting right-to-repair policies.",
        "In conclusion, businesses emphasise that products are new because novelty helps them compete and drive sales. While genuine innovation can be useful, the broader culture of constant upgrading makes this development slightly more negative than positive."

Finally, not all homes provide a quiet workspace, so inequality can increase between those with good living conditions and those without.\n\nIn conclusion, working from home offers flexibility and cost savings, but it can weaken teamwork and blur boundaries. A balanced approach, such as hybrid schedules and clear expectations about availability, is likely to deliver the best outcomes.",
